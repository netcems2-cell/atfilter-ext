## Description

@Filter is a free browser extension that lets you filter unwanted content across the web using keywords you choose.

**How it works**
Add keywords to your filter list, and @Filter automatically hides articles, videos, and posts whose headlines contain those words. It works across news sites, social media, video platforms, and more.

**Features**
- Keyword-based filtering — block content by the words that matter to you
- Works everywhere — news sites, social media, YouTube, Reddit, and more
- Unlimited keywords — add as many filter terms as you need
- Instant setup — no account, no registration, just install and go
- Privacy-first — all filtering runs locally in your browser
- Lightweight — minimal permissions, no background tracking
- Community-powered — your anonymous filtering choices help build @Map, a global content sentiment platform

**Privacy**
@Filter processes everything locally in your browser. We don't collect your browsing history, don't track which sites you visit, and don't sell any information. The only data shared (with your consent) is anonymous, aggregated filtering patterns that power @Map.

**What is @Map?**
@Map is a community sentiment platform that visualizes what content people are filtering worldwide. It's powered by anonymous data from @Filter users. You can opt out of community participation at any time through Settings.

**Free forever** — no premium tiers, no ads, no hidden costs.
