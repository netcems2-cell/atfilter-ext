# Legal Documents Tone Improvement Changelog

## Overview

Comprehensive revision of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to:
1. Add ™ trademark symbols to every mention of @ Filter™ and @ Map™
2. Replace defensive, negative framing with positive, confident language
3. Maintain legal protections while improving user experience

---

## Trademark Symbols Added

**@ Filter™:** 72 instances in Terms, 48 instances in Privacy Policy  
**@ Map™:** Applied throughout both documents

**Why this matters:** Establishes @ Filter and @ Map as specific trademarked products, not just descriptive phrases combining symbols and words. Critical for trademark protection.
