**Last Updated:** [Current Date]

---

## Welcome to @ Filter & @ Map

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the @ Filter browser extension and your participation in the @ Map platform (collectively, the "Service"). By installing, accessing, or using @ Filter, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

**Please read these Terms carefully before using @ Filter.**

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

### 1.1 Agreement to Terms

By installing or using @ Map, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

### 1.2 Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes through:
- In-extension notifications
- Updated "Last Updated" date
- Email (if provided for other purposes)

Continued use of @ Map after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

### 1.3 Age Requirement

You must be at least 18 years old to use @ Map. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.

---

## 2. The @ Map Service

### 2.1 What @ Filter & @ Map Are

**@ Filter** is a browser extension that provides content filtering functionality.

**@ Map** is a community-powered sentiment platform that fundamentally requires essential data contribution. Collectively, our voices are heard around the globe.

**The Relationship:** @ Map is powered by @ Filter users and potentially other data sources.

The Service:
- Provides content filtering functionality through @ Filter
- Collects anonymous data about filtering choices (with your consent)
- Creates real-time visualizations of global filtering patterns on @ Map
- Offers insights into collective online sentiment

### 2.2 How It Works

**The Service Model:**
1. You install the @ Filter browser extension
2. You use the filtering functionality to block unwanted content
3. You choose to contribute anonymous filtering data to @ Map
4. Data is aggregated with other users' data
5. The @ Map visualization shows global patterns
6. Researchers and businesses can access aggregated insights via the @ Map API

### 2.3 Community Platform

@ Map is fundamentally a sentiment platform powered by collective voices. The value comes from community participation. Individual use without data contribution does not align with @ Map's purpose.

---

## 3. Data Contribution Requirement

### 3.1 Essential Service Component

**Important:** Data contribution is not optional—it is essential to @ Map's core functionality.

@ Map cannot exist without community data contribution. The global visualization, regional insights, and research value all depend on aggregated user data. There is no "@ Map" without the map, and there is no map without data.

### 3.2 What You Agree to Contribute

By using @ Map, you agree to contribute anonymized data about:
- Content categories you filter
- Your approximate geographic region
- Timing of filtering activity
- Technical information (browser type, OS)

See our Privacy Policy for complete details about what is and is not collected.

### 3.3 Right to Opt-Out

You may pause data contribution at any time through Settings. However:

**If you opt out:**
- ✅ Basic filtering continues to function
- ❌ @ Map visualization features become unavailable
- ❌ Regional sentiment insights are disabled
- ❌ Trending patterns are hidden
- ❌ Community features are restricted

**Service Limitation:**
We reserve the right to discontinue Service access for users who consistently opt out of data contribution, as @ Map cannot function as intended without community participation.

### 3.4 No Compensation

You will not receive financial compensation for data contribution. The value exchange is:
- You receive: Free filtering tool + access to global visualizations
- You contribute: Anonymous filtering data

---

## 4. Acceptable Use
