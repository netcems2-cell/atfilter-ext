## 2. @ Filter™ and @ Map™

### 2.1 What @ Filter™ & @ Map™ Are

**@ Filter™** is a browser extension that provides content filtering functionality.

**@ Map™** is a community-powered sentiment platform that fundamentally requires community participation through anonymous data sharing. Collectively, our voices are heard around the globe.

**The Relationship:** @ Map™ is powered by @ Filter™ users and potentially other data sources.

The Service:
- Provides content filtering functionality through @ Filter™
- Collects anonymous data about filtering choices (with your consent)
- Creates real-time visualizations of global filtering patterns on @ Map™
- Offers insights into collective online sentiment

### 2.2 How It Works

**The Service Model:**
1. You install the @ Filter™ browser extension
2. You use the filtering functionality to block unwanted content
3. You choose to contribute anonymous filtering data to @ Map™
4. Data is aggregated with other users' data
5. The @ Map™ visualization shows global patterns
6. Researchers and businesses can access aggregated insights via the @ Map™ API

### 2.3 Community Platform

@ Map™ is fundamentally a sentiment platform powered by collective voices. The value comes from community participation. Individual use without participating in the community does not align with @ Map™'s purpose.

---

## 3. Community Participation Requirement

### 3.1 Essential Service Component

**Important:** Community participation through anonymous data sharing is essential to @ Map™'s core functionality.

@ Map™ exists because of community participation. The global visualization, regional insights, and research value all come from aggregated user data. The map is the data—one creates the other.

### 3.2 What You Agree to Share

**Default Opt-In:** By installing @ Filter™ and accepting these Terms and the Privacy Policy, you automatically consent to community participation in @ Map™ through anonymous data sharing. This default opt-in setting begins immediately upon installation.

You agree to share anonymized data about:
- Content categories you filter
- Your approximate geographic region
- Timing of filtering activity
- Technical information (browser type, OS)

See our Privacy Policy for complete details about what is and is not collected.

### 3.3 Right to Opt-Out

You may pause community participation at any time through @ Filter™ Settings. However:

**With Community Participation:**
- ✅ @ Filter™ extension fully functional
- ✅ Content filtering active
- ✅ @ Map™ visualization features
- ✅ Regional sentiment insights
- ✅ Trending patterns
- ✅ Community features

**Without Participation:**
- ⚪ @ Filter™ extension becomes inactive (greyed out)
- ⚪ Content filtering deactivated
- ⚪ @ Map™ features unavailable

**Why:** @ Filter™ and @ Map™ fundamentally require community participation to function. The extension operates as a community-powered platform.

### 3.4 No Compensation

You will not receive financial compensation for community participation. The value exchange is:
- You receive: Free filtering tool + access to global visualizations
- You contribute: Anonymous filtering data through community participation

---
