**Effective Date:** [Current Date]

**Last Updated:** [Current Date]

## Welcome to @ Filter & @ Map

@ Filter is a browser extension that provides content filtering. When you use @ Filter, you can choose to contribute anonymous data to @ Map, a community-powered sentiment platform that fundamentally requires essential data contribution. Collectively, our voices are heard around the globe.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how we protect it, and your rights and choices.

---

## 1. The @ Filter & @ Map Model

### What @ Filter Is

@ Filter is a browser extension that blocks unwanted content, providing you with a cleaner, more focused browsing experience.

### What @ Map Is

@ Map is a community-powered sentiment platform. When you use @ Filter, you can choose to join the global @ Map community by contributing anonymous data about your content filtering choices. This data is aggregated to create real-time visualizations showing what content people are blocking worldwide.

### The Relationship

@ Filter powers @ Map. Your use of the extension can contribute to the collective intelligence of the platform.

### Why We Collect Data

@ Map fundamentally requires essential data contribution to function. Without community participation from @ Filter users and other sources, @ Map cannot exist. There is no map without the data.

### The Value Exchange

- **You Receive:** @ Filter (free, powerful content filtering tool) + access to @ Map global visualizations
- **You Contribute:** Anonymous data about what types of content you filter
- **The World Gets:** @ Map insights into collective online behavior and sentiment

---

## 4. How We Protect Your Privacy

### 4.1 Differential Privacy

We employ advanced privacy protection techniques including:

**Geographic Aggregation:**
- Data is only reported for regions with minimum 100 active users
- Individual cities or neighborhoods are never shown in isolation
- Sparse data is excluded to prevent re-identification

**Temporal Binning:**
- Activity is aggregated into hourly time windows
- Precise timestamps are never stored or shared
- Patterns are smoothed to prevent timing-based identification

**Category Generalization:**
- Specific filter rules are mapped to broad categories
- Unusual or rare filtering patterns are excluded
- Only common categories appear in public data

**Noise Injection:**
- Random statistical noise is added to all counts
- Prevents exact reverse-engineering of individual contributions
- Maintains statistical validity while protecting individuals

**K-Anonymity:**
- Every data point represents at least K users (K ≥ 100)
- No unique or rare combinations are exposed
- Cross-referencing attacks are prevented

### 4.2 Technical Security

**Data in Transit:**
- All data transmitted using TLS encryption
- Secure HTTPS connections only
- No unencrypted data transmission

**Data at Rest:**
- Encrypted database storage
- Access controls and authentication
- Regular security audits

**Data Minimization:**
- We collect only what's necessary
- Raw data is immediately aggregated
- Individual-level data is not retained long-term

### 4.3 No Cross-Site Tracking

- @ Map does not track you across websites
- No tracking cookies or pixels
- No integration with advertising networks
- No data sharing with ad platforms

---

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

### 5.1 Who We Share With

**API Customers** (as described in Section 3.3):
- Receive only aggregated, anonymized data
- Bound by strict terms prohibiting re-identification attempts
- Monitored for compliance

**Service Providers:**

All service providers are contractually obligated to protect data and use it only for @ Map purposes.

### 5.2 What We Never Share

We NEVER:
- ❌ Sell individual user data
- ❌ Share personally identifiable information
- ❌ Provide data to advertising networks
- ❌ Allow re-identification of users
- ❌ Share raw, non-anonymized data

### 5.3 Legal Requirements

We may disclose information if required by law:

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

### 6.1 Opt-Out at Any Time

You have complete control over data contribution:

**How to Opt-Out:**
1. Open @ Map Settings
2. Toggle "Data Contribution" to OFF
3. Confirm your choice

**What Happens When You Opt-Out:**
- ✅ Your filtering tool continues to work
- ✅ You can still block content
- ❌ @ Map visualization features will be limited
- ❌ You won't see regional sentiment insights
- ❌ Trending patterns will be unavailable

**Re-Enabling:**
You can turn data contribution back ON at any time in Settings.

### 6.2 View Your Contributed Data

You can request to see what categories of data you've contributed:

1. Go to @ Map Settings

### 6.3 Request Data Deletion

You can request deletion of your contributed data:

1. Go to @ Map Settings
2. Click "Request Data Deletion"

**Important:**

- Deletion means we stop collecting new data from you
- Historical aggregate statistics that included your data will remain (as they cannot be de-aggregated)
- This is similar to how Google Trends cannot remove your specific search from trend data
