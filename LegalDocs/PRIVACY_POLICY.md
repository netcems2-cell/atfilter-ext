## Welcome to @ Filter™ & @ Map™

@ Filter™ is a browser extension that provides content filtering. When you use @ Filter™, you can choose to participate in @ Map™, a community-powered sentiment platform that fundamentally requires community participation through anonymous data sharing. Collectively, our voices are heard around the globe.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how we protect it, and your rights and choices.

## 1. The @ Filter™ & @ Map™ Model

### What @ Filter™ Is

@ Filter™ is a browser extension that blocks unwanted content, providing you with a cleaner, more focused browsing experience.

### What @ Map™ Is

@ Map™ is a community-powered sentiment platform. When you use @ Filter™, you can choose to join the global @ Map™ community through anonymous data participation. Your filtering choices are aggregated to create real-time visualizations showing what content people are blocking worldwide.

### The Relationship

@ Filter™ powers @ Map™. Your use of the extension can contribute to the collective intelligence of the platform through community participation.

### Why We Collect Data

@ Map™ fundamentally requires community participation to function. Anonymous data participation from @ Filter™ users and other sources creates @ Map™. The map is the data.

**Default Opt-In:** When you install @ Filter™ and accept the Terms and Privacy Policy, you are automatically opted in for community participation in @ Map™. This default opt-in enables @ Filter™ to provide the full @ Map™ experience immediately. You can opt-out at any time through Settings.

### The Value Exchange

- **You Receive:** @ Filter™ (free, powerful content filtering tool) + access to @ Map™ global visualizations
- **You Contribute:** Anonymous data about what types of content you filter (opt-in by default)
- **The World Gets:** @ Map™ insights into collective online behavior and sentiment

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### When Data Collection Begins

**Default Opt-In:** When you install @ Filter™ and accept the Terms and Privacy Policy during the onboarding process, you automatically consent to community participation in @ Map™ through anonymous data sharing. This default opt-in setting begins data collection immediately and enables full @ Map™ features.

You can opt-out at any time through @ Filter™ Settings, though this will limit @ Map™ visualization features. See Section 6 for details on your control options.

### 2.1 What We DO Collect (Anonymous Only)

We collect the following anonymized information:

**Filter Activity Data:**
- **Content categories** you choose to block (e.g., "advertisements," "social media," "news")
- **NOT specific URLs** - we never see which exact websites you visit
- **NOT page content** - we never see what's on the pages you visit

**Geographic Information:**
- **Approximate location** at city/region level derived from your IP address
- **NOT precise location** - we don't collect GPS coordinates or exact addresses

**Timing Information:**
- **When filtering occurs** - aggregated to hourly time bins
- **NOT precise timestamps** - we don't track minute-by-minute activity

**Technical Information:**
- **Browser type** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) for compatibility purposes
- **Operating system** (e.g., Windows, macOS) for compatibility purposes
- **Extension version** to ensure you have the latest features

### 2.2 What We Protect (Not Collected)

---

## 4. How We Protect Your Privacy

### 4.1 Differential Privacy

We employ advanced privacy protection techniques including:

**Geographic Aggregation:**
- Data reports only for regions with 100+ active users
- Individual cities blend into larger regional patterns
- Sparse areas protected by minimum threshold

**Temporal Binning:**
- Activity groups into hourly time windows
- Timestamps aggregate for pattern analysis
- Smoothing prevents timing-based identification

**Category Generalization:**
- Specific filter rules map to broad categories
- Unusual patterns filter out automatically
- Common categories form the public dataset

**Noise Injection:**
- Random statistical noise is added to all counts
- Prevents exact reverse-engineering of individual contributions
- Maintains statistical validity while protecting individuals

**K-Anonymity:**
- Every data point represents at least K users (K ≥ 100)
- No unique or rare combinations are exposed
- Cross-referencing attacks are prevented

### 4.2 Technical Security

**Data in Transit:**
- TLS encryption for all data transmission
- HTTPS connections throughout
- Secure communication channels

**Data at Rest:**
- Encrypted database storage
- Access controls and authentication
- Regular security audits

**Data Minimization:**
- Collection limited to essentials
- Immediate aggregation of raw data
- Storage focuses on aggregated patterns

### 4.3 Privacy-First Design

- @ Filter™ operates only on pages where you choose to use it
- Uses no tracking cookies or pixels
- Independent from advertising networks
- Zero integration with ad platforms

---

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

### 5.1 Who We Share With

**API Customers** (as described in Section 3.3):

- Monitored for compliance

**Service Providers:**

**@ Map™ is built on these principles:**
- ✅ Aggregate data only—individuals remain invisible
- ✅ Anonymous patterns, not personal profiles

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

### 6.1 Opt-Out at Any Time

When you install @ Filter™ and accept the Terms and Privacy Policy, you are automatically opted in for community participation in @ Map™. This is the default setting that enables the full @ Map™ experience.

You have complete control to change this at any time:

**How to Opt-Out:**
1. Open @ Filter™ Settings
2. Toggle "Community Participation" to OFF
3. Confirm your choice

**What Happens Based on Your Choice:**

**With Community Participation (default):**
- ✅ @ Filter™ extension fully functional
- ✅ Content filtering active
- ✅ @ Map™ visualization features enabled
- ✅ Regional sentiment insights available
- ✅ Trending patterns visible

**Without Participation:**
- ⚪ @ Filter™ extension becomes inactive (greyed out)
- ⚪ Content filtering deactivated
- ⚪ @ Map™ features unavailable

**Why:** @ Filter™ and @ Map™ fundamentally require community participation to function as a community-powered platform.

**Re-Enabling:**
You can turn community participation back ON at any time in Settings to restore full functionality.

### 6.2 View Your Contributed Data

You can request to see what categories of data you've contributed:

1. Go to @ Filter™ Settings
2. Click "View My Contributed Data"
3. See aggregated categories you've filtered

Note: Differential privacy creates general patterns from your data, showing broad trends rather than specific actions.

### 6.3 Request Data Deletion

You can request deletion of your contributed data:

1. Go to @ Filter™ Settings
2. Click "Request Data Deletion"
3. Confirm deletion

**How Deletion Works with Anonymized Data:** 
- Data becomes anonymous the moment it's collected through aggregation
- Deletion stops all future data collection from your installation
- Historical aggregates (which blend thousands of users) remain part of @ Map™
- This is how all anonymous analytics platforms work (Google Trends, Waze, etc.)

### 6.4 Uninstall

You can uninstall @ Filter™ at any time:
- All local data is immediately removed
- Data collection stops instantly
- You can reinstall later if you choose

---

- Cannot be de-aggregated to identify individuals

**Settings and Preferences:**

### 7.2 No Persistent Identifiers

@ Map™ does not assign you a permanent user ID or account identifier. Each session is treated independently and anonymously.

---

## 8. Age Requirements

@ Map™ is designed for users 18 and older. The service focuses on adult internet usage patterns. If you're under 18, we ask that you explore other browsing tools designed for younger users.

If we learn information was collected from someone under 18, we'll remove it promptly.

---

## 9. International Data Transfers

@ Filter™ and @ Map™ are operated from the United States. If you use the Service from outside the U.S., your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States.

- Standard contractual clauses
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Differential privacy protections
- Limited data collection
