    <h1>@Filter™ &amp; @Map™ Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 16, 2026 &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 16, 2026</p>

    <h2>Welcome to @Filter™ &amp; @Map™</h2>
    <p>@Filter™ is a browser extension that provides content filtering. When you use @Filter™, you can choose to contribute anonymous data to @Map™, a community-powered sentiment platform that fundamentally requires essential data contribution. Collectively, our voices are heard around the globe.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how we protect it, and your rights and choices.</p>

    <h2>1. The @Filter™ &amp; @Map™ Model</h2>
    <h3>What @Filter™ Is</h3>
    <p>@Filter™ is a browser extension that blocks unwanted content, providing you with a cleaner, more focused browsing experience.</p>

    <h3>What @Map™ Is</h3>
    <p>@Map™ is a community-powered sentiment platform. When you use @Filter™, you can choose to join the global @Map™ community by contributing anonymous data about your content filtering choices. This data is aggregated to create real-time visualizations showing what content people are blocking worldwide.</p>

    <h3>The Relationship</h3>
    <p>@Filter™ powers @Map™. Your use of the extension can contribute to the collective intelligence of the platform.</p>

    <h3>Why We Collect Data</h3>
    <p>@Map™ fundamentally requires essential data contribution to function. Without community participation from @Filter™ users and other sources, @Map™ cannot exist. There is no map without the data.</p>

    <h3>The Value Exchange</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>You Receive:</strong> @Filter™ (free, powerful content filtering tool) + access to @Map™ global visualizations</li>
      <li><strong>You Contribute:</strong> Anonymous data about what types of content you filter</li>
      <li><strong>The World Gets:</strong> @Map™ insights into collective online behavior and sentiment</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>2.1 What We DO Collect (Anonymous Only)</h3>
    <div class="do-collect">
      <p><strong>Filter Activity Data:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Content categories</strong> you choose to block (e.g., "advertisements," "social media," "news")</li>
        <li><strong>NOT specific URLs</strong> — we never see which exact websites you visit</li>
        <li><strong>NOT page content</strong> — we never see what's on the pages you visit</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Geographic Information:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> at city/region level derived from your IP address</li>
        <li><strong>NOT precise location</strong> — we don't collect GPS coordinates or exact addresses</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Timing Information:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>When filtering occurs</strong> — aggregated to hourly time bins</li>
        <li><strong>NOT precise timestamps</strong> — we don't track minute-by-minute activity</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Technical Information:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Browser type</strong> (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) for compatibility purposes</li>
        <li><strong>Operating system</strong> (e.g., Windows, macOS) for compatibility purposes</li>
        <li><strong>Extension version</strong> to ensure you have the latest features</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>2.2 What We DO NOT Collect</h3>
    <div class="dont-collect">
      <p>We explicitly and intentionally do <strong>NOT</strong> collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name, email address, or any personal identifiers</li>
        <li>Your complete browsing history</li>
        <li>Specific URLs you visit</li>
        <li>Content of web pages you view</li>
        <li>Passwords or form data</li>
        <li>Information from incognito/private browsing</li>
        <li>Data that could identify you as an individual</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>2.3 No Account Required</h3>
    <p>@Map™ does not require account creation. We do not collect or store usernames, passwords, email addresses, phone numbers, or payment information (service is free).</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Creating the @Map™ Visualization</h3>
    <p>Your anonymized data contributes to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Real-time global map</strong> showing filtering patterns by region</li>
      <li><strong>Trending content categories</strong> people are blocking</li>
      <li><strong>Temporal patterns</strong> showing how filtering behavior changes over time</li>
      <li><strong>Comparative insights</strong> between different geographic regions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Research and Insights</h3>
    <p>We aggregate and analyze data to understand collective online sentiment and concerns, global and regional content consumption patterns, emerging trends in online behavior, and public interest in different content types.</p>

    <h3>3.3 API Services</h3>
    <p>We provide aggregated, anonymized data through our @Map™ API to:</p>
    <p><strong>Who Has Access:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Academic researchers studying online behavior</li>
      <li>Journalists reporting on digital trends and public sentiment</li>
      <li>Market research firms analyzing consumer behavior</li>
      <li>Policy researchers studying internet usage patterns</li>
      <li>Data scientists conducting societal impact studies</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What They Receive:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aggregated statistics (never individual-level data)</li>
      <li>Regional trends (minimum 100 users per data point)</li>
      <li>Time-binned patterns (hourly aggregates)</li>
      <li>Category-level information (generalized, not specific)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Revenue Model:</strong> API access is a paid service that supports @Map™'s operation and keeps the extension free for users.</p>

    <h3>3.4 Service Improvement</h3>
    <p>We use aggregated data to improve filtering accuracy, optimize performance, develop new features, and fix bugs and issues.</p>

    <h2>4. How We Protect Your Privacy</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Differential Privacy</h3>
    <p>We employ advanced privacy protection techniques including:</p>
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Geographic Aggregation:</strong> Data is only reported for regions with minimum 100 active users. Individual cities or neighborhoods are never shown in isolation.</p>
      <p><strong>Temporal Binning:</strong> Activity is aggregated into hourly time windows. Precise timestamps are never stored or shared.</p>
      <p><strong>Category Generalization:</strong> Specific filter rules are mapped to broad categories. Unusual or rare filtering patterns are excluded.</p>
      <p><strong>Noise Injection:</strong> Random statistical noise is added to all counts. Prevents exact reverse-engineering of individual contributions.</p>
      <p><strong>K-Anonymity:</strong> Every data point represents at least K users (K &ge; 100). No unique or rare combinations are exposed.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>4.2 Technical Security</h3>
    <p><strong>Data in Transit:</strong> All data transmitted using TLS encryption, secure HTTPS connections only, no unencrypted data transmission.</p>
    <p><strong>Data at Rest:</strong> Encrypted database storage, access controls and authentication, regular security audits.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We collect only what's necessary, raw data is immediately aggregated, individual-level data is not retained long-term.</p>

    <h3>4.3 No Cross-Site Tracking</h3>
    <p>@Map™ does not track you across websites. No tracking cookies or pixels. No integration with advertising networks. No data sharing with ad platforms.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Who We Share With</h3>
    <p><strong>API Customers</strong> (as described in Section 3.3): Receive only aggregated, anonymized data. Bound by strict terms prohibiting re-identification attempts. Monitored for compliance.</p>
    <p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Cloud hosting (for data storage and processing), analytics tools (using anonymized data only), security services (to protect the platform). All service providers are contractually obligated to protect data and use it only for @Map™ purposes.</p>

    <h3>5.2 What We Never Share</h3>
    <div class="dont-collect">
      <p>We <strong>NEVER</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sell individual user data</li>
        <li>Share personally identifiable information</li>
        <li>Provide data to advertising networks</li>
        <li>Allow re-identification of users</li>
        <li>Share raw, non-anonymized data</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>5.3 Legal Requirements</h3>
    <p>We may disclose information if required by law: valid court orders or subpoenas, legal process requiring disclosure, protection of our rights or safety of others, prevention of fraud or security threats. Even in these cases, we can only provide the anonymized, aggregated data we actually collect.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <h3>6.1 Opt-Out at Any Time</h3>
    <p>You have complete control over data contribution:</p>
    <p><strong>How to Opt-Out:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open @Filter™ Settings</li>
      <li>Toggle "Data Contribution" to OFF</li>
      <li>Confirm your choice</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>What Happens When You Opt-Out:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>&#10004; Your filtering tool continues to work</li>
      <li>&#10004; You can still block content</li>
      <li>&#10008; @Map™ visualization features will be limited</li>
      <li>&#10008; You won't see regional sentiment insights</li>
      <li>&#10008; Trending patterns will be unavailable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can turn data contribution back ON at any time in Settings.</p>

    <h3>6.2 View Your Contributed Data</h3>
    <p>You can request to see what categories of data you've contributed via @Filter™ Settings. Because we use differential privacy, the data shown is generalized and may not exactly match every individual action.</p>

    <h3>6.3 Request Data Deletion</h3>
    <p>You can request deletion of your contributed data via @Filter™ Settings.</p>
    <div class="warning-box">
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Because data is immediately aggregated and anonymized, individual contributions cannot be "extracted" from aggregate statistics. Deletion means we stop collecting new data from you. Historical aggregate statistics that included your data will remain (as they cannot be de-aggregated). This is similar to how Google Trends cannot remove your specific search from trend data.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>6.4 Uninstall</h3>
    <p>You can uninstall @Filter™ at any time. All local data is immediately removed, data collection stops instantly, and you can reinstall later if you choose.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <h3>7.1 Retention Periods</h3>
    <p><strong>Raw Event Data:</strong> Stored only temporarily during aggregation process, deleted within 24 hours after aggregation, never retained long-term.</p>
    <p><strong>Aggregated Data:</strong> Retained indefinitely to maintain historical @Map™ visualizations. Forms the permanent research dataset. Cannot be de-aggregated to identify individuals.</p>
    <p><strong>Settings and Preferences:</strong> Stored locally in your browser. Deleted when you uninstall the extension.</p>

    <h3>7.2 No Persistent Identifiers</h3>
    <p>@Map™ does not assign you a permanent user ID or account identifier. Each session is treated independently and anonymously.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>@Map™ is not directed to children under 18. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you are under 18, please do not use @Map™. If we learn we have collected information from a child under 18, we will delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>@Map™ is operated from the United States. If you use @Map™ from outside the U.S., your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States.</p>
    <p>We implement appropriate safeguards to protect your information regardless of where it is processed, including standard contractual clauses, encryption in transit and at rest, differential privacy protections, and limited data collection.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted with a new "Effective Date" at the top.</p>
    <p><strong>We will notify you of material changes by:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>In-extension notification</li>
      <li>Prominent notice on @Map™ website</li>
      <li>Email (if we have your email for other reasons)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Continued use of @Map™ after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>11. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <h3>11.1 No Third-Party Tracking</h3>
    <p>@Map™ does not integrate with social media platforms, advertising networks, analytics trackers (beyond our own anonymous analytics), or marketing platforms.</p>

    <h3>11.2 Links to Other Services</h3>
    <p>@Map™ may contain links to external websites or services. We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Review their privacy policies before providing information. Our policy does not apply to third-party sites.</p>

    <h2>12. Your California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you have additional rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> What categories of information we collect (see Section 2), how we use it (see Section 3), who we share it with (see Section 5)</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> Request deletion of your data (see Section 6.3)</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out:</strong> Opt out of data collection (see Section 6.1)</li>
      <li><strong>No Sale of Personal Information:</strong> We do not sell personal information as defined by CCPA. We provide aggregated, anonymized data through our API. This is not considered a "sale" under CCPA.</li>
      <li><strong>No Discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights. @Map™ features may be limited if you opt out (as the service requires data to function).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>13. European Privacy Rights (GDPR)</h2>
